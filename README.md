# Semantic Kernel Playground

## Introduction to Semantic Kernel

Semantic Kernel is an open-source framework developed by Microsoft that enables developers to integrate AI models, such as OpenAI's GPT, with traditional programming paradigms. It provides tools for creating intelligent applications that combine natural language processing, reasoning, and decision-making capabilities.

This repository serves as a playground for exploring Semantic Kernel through various exercises and examples. It is designed to help developers understand the core concepts and features of Semantic Kernel while experimenting with its capabilities.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/semantic-kernel-playground.git
    ```

2. create an environment:

```bash
// Create a virtual environment named 'skplayground'
python -m venv .skplayground

// On Windows, activate the environment
.skplayground\Scripts\activate

// On macOS/Linux, activate the environment
source .skplayground/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Follow the exercises in the `src` folder to start learning Semantic Kernel.
